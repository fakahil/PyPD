# This package will contain the necessary modules to perform the phase diversity and other functionalities in image processing and restoration.
# It has to come with a documentation on how to use the package (functions and passing parameters)
# It will be improved with time (so better to write it on local machine and git with gtithub for changes)
## Modules:

-- The main PD code (mainly just the minimization)
-- Tools module:
 -- PSF and MTF module: power spectrum, fourier transform 
 -- Telescope module which takes in the telescope parameters, defocus..
 -- Target module which takes in the size
 -- Aperture module which takes in the shape of the aperture necessary for making the mask and corresponding size
 -- Zernike module for computing the polynomials or just implementing them
 -- wavefront aberrations computation


## to_include: 

-- a function that computes zernike coefficient from a given wavelength shift
--
