# PyPD

This repo contains a Python package that I have written for applying Phase Diversity Reconstruction on Solar Orbiter data (or any other telescope with a circular aperture). It could be applied on any astronomical data as well. 

It is based on the algorithm described in [LÃ¶fdahl and Scharmer. 1994](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994A&AS..107..243L)
